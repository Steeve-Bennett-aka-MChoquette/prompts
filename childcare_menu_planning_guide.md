Create a comprehensive menu planning guide for home daycare providers that adheres to the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) guidelines in the United States. The guide should include:

- Meal and snack ideas for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks that meet CACFP nutritional standards.
- Recommendations for incorporating fresh produce into the meals.
- Information on fresh produce that is in season during different times of the year, specifying which produce is available during each season (spring, summer, fall, and winter).

The response should be structured in a user-friendly format, possibly with separate sections for each meal type and each season of produce. Make sure to emphasize the health benefits of following CACFP guidelines and provide variety to keep meals interesting for children.

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
