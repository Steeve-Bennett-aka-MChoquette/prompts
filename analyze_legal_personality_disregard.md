Discuss in detail the circumstances under which the principle of separate legal personality, which states that a company is a separate legal entity from its owners and directors, might be disregarded. In your response, cover the following points:

- Explain the concept of "piercing the corporate veil" and when it might be applicable.
- Describe legal scenarios or court cases where the separate legal entity principle has been set aside.
- Discuss the implications of disregarding the separate legal personality for the directors or owners of the company.
- Provide examples of legal jurisdictions where this practice is more common and why it is applied.
- Include potential risks and consequences for both the company and its stakeholders when this separation is overlooked.
