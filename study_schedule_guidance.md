Help me stay disciplined and scheduled in my studies for the medical residency exam. I need guidance to maintain a structured study schedule, including:

- Creating a detailed and realistic study plan tailored to the medical residency exam.
- Strategies to maintain discipline and avoid procrastination.
- Periodic reminders and check-ins to ensure I am staying on track.
- Motivation tips to keep my spirits high throughout the preparation period.
- Advice on taking effective breaks and managing stress.

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
