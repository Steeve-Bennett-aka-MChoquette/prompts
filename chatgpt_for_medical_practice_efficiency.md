Help my friend, an OB-gynecologist with a private clinic, leverage ChatGPT to improve the efficiency of her practice and save time. Consider the following points:

- How she can use ChatGPT to streamline appointment scheduling and management.
- Ideas for using ChatGPT to enhance patient communication and follow-ups.
- Suggestions on automating routine administrative tasks with ChatGPT.
- Strategies for using ChatGPT to manage and grow her clinicâ€™s Facebook page with minimal effort.

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
