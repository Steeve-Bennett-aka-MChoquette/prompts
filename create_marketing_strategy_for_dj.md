Create a comprehensive action plan and marketing strategy for a DJ/producer aiming to revitalize their career. Consider the following objectives:

- **Social Media Action Plan**: Develop a strategy to effectively utilize social media platforms for increased visibility and engagement. Include specific platforms, content types, posting frequency, and tips for boosting interaction and visibility.

- **Community Building**: Outline steps to create and nurture a strong, engaged community around the DJ/producer's music. Consider leveraging online forums, fan interactions, collaborations with other artists, and events (online and offline).

- **Marketing Budget Breakdown**: Provide a detailed budget outline for marketing efforts, highlighting key areas like social media advertising, content creation, and promotional events. Suggest cost-effective methods and any free resources available.

- **Career Goals**:
  - Devise a strategy to secure at least 4 shows per month, including potential venues, networking tips, and strategies for reaching out to booking agents.
  - Create a plan to produce and pitch at least 3 EPs to major labels. Include steps for production, identifying the right labels, preparing pitches, and networking with label representatives.

Use actionable steps and timelines for each part of the plan, and include any helpful resources or tools that the DJ/producer can use.
