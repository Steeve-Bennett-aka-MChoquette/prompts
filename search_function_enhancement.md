### ChatGPT Prompt

I have a request about enhancing a website. Could you please:

1. Design a search function for the website that specifically allows users to search for existing prompts?
2. Describe the technical steps or technologies required to implement this search function.
3. Suggest any best practices for optimizing the search function for performance and user experience.
4. Explain how to ensure the search function is secure and protects user data.

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
