Create a timetable for personal training sessions at a physio practice. Use the following guidelines to organize the schedule:

- Input: Unstructured data containing availability of clients.
- Output: Structured timetable including:
  - Day 
  - Time 
  - Session attendees (based on their availability)

- Key Requirements:
  - Two attendees per session. Ensure each session is filled to capacity where possible.
  - Prioritize creating a primary timetable but also develop an alternative option.
  - Consider each client's availability to minimize scheduling conflicts.

- Additional Instructions:
  - Ensure flexibility for future adjustments to the timetable.
  - Identify patterns or common availability to optimize session distribution.
