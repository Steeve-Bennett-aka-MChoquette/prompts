Create a comprehensive list of words that should be avoided when creating content. Your response should include:

- Words that are generally considered overly complex or jargon that might confuse the audience.
- Buzzwords or clich√©s that might detract from the credibility of the content.
- Words or phrases that may be considered insensitive or offensive to diverse audiences.
- Expressions that typically add little value or create ambiguity, negatively impacting clarity or persuasiveness.
- Insights into why each word should be avoided and suggest alternatives that could be more effective.

Organize the information clearly, using examples where applicable. Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
